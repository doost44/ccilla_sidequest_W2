## Description

An emotion-driven puzzle game where a blob navigates colored aura zones. Place matching colored boxes to trigger emotional states that stack and affect movement—anger adds wobble, nausea reverses controls, joy speeds you up, and sadness slows you down. Win by placing all four boxes simultaneously while managing combined emotional effects.

## Interaction Instructions

**Controls:**

- **WASD / Arrows**: Move the blob
- **E**: Pick up boxes (also removes active emotions)
- **Q**: Place boxes in aura zones
- **R**: Restart after victory

**Gameplay:**  
Place colored boxes in matching aura zones to activate 15-second emotions. Effects stack—combine multiple emotions for complex challenges. When emotions expire, boxes slide off edges and respawn randomly. Achieve victory by filling all four zones simultaneously.
